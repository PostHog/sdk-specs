## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Canonical before-send-hook behavior

The SDK SHALL implement the canonical `before-send-hook` behavior described by this spec. Implementations MAY adapt method names, parameter casing, type syntax, and lifecycle hooks to platform idioms where this spec explicitly allows variation, but MUST preserve the observable outcomes in the scenarios below.

If any before-send hook throws, the SDK SHALL catch the exception, record a warning, stop the remaining hook chain, and drop the event. The SDK MUST NOT enqueue the original event or the last successfully transformed value because the failed hook may have been responsible for removing sensitive data.

#### Scenario: Before-send can mutate an assembled event before enqueue
- **GIVEN** a fresh SDK acceptance test harness
- **AND** the SDK clock is fixed at "2025-01-01T00:00:00Z"
- **AND** persistent storage is empty
- **AND** the mock PostHog server is reset
- **GIVEN** the SDK is initialized with token "test-token"
- **AND** before-send adds property "privacy" with value "filtered"
- **WHEN** capture is called with event "Checkout Started"
- **THEN** one event named "Checkout Started" should be enqueued
- **AND** the enqueued event property "privacy" should equal "filtered"

#### Scenario: Before-send can drop an event
- **GIVEN** a fresh SDK acceptance test harness
- **AND** the SDK clock is fixed at "2025-01-01T00:00:00Z"
- **AND** persistent storage is empty
- **AND** the mock PostHog server is reset
- **GIVEN** the SDK is initialized with token "test-token"
- **AND** before-send drops events named "Secret Event"
- **WHEN** capture is called with event "Secret Event"
- **THEN** no event named "Secret Event" should be enqueued

#### Scenario: Before-send exceptions drop events without crashing callers
- **GIVEN** a fresh SDK acceptance test harness
- **AND** the SDK clock is fixed at "2025-01-01T00:00:00Z"
- **AND** persistent storage is empty
- **AND** the mock PostHog server is reset
- **GIVEN** the SDK is initialized with token "test-token"
- **AND** before-send throws an exception
- **WHEN** capture is called with event "Safe Event"
- **THEN** the capture call should not throw
- **AND** no event named "Safe Event" should be enqueued
- **AND** the SDK should record a before-send warning
