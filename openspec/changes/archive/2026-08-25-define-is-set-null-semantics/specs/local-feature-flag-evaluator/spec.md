## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: is_set distinguishes property presence from unavailable context

The local evaluator SHALL match an `is_set` property filter whenever the required evaluation property key is present. A property explicitly supplied with the platform's JSON null equivalent SHALL match `is_set`, because the key is present.

Boolean false, numeric zero, an empty string, and empty collections SHALL also count as set. Implementations SHALL test property membership and SHALL NOT use generic language truthiness or a non-null check to decide whether a property is set.

When the required property key is absent from caller-supplied local evaluation context, the evaluator SHALL remain inconclusive and defer to remote evaluation when remote fallback is enabled. Omission from request-time properties does not prove that the property is absent from PostHog's stored person or group properties.

#### Scenario: Explicit null matches is_set
- **GIVEN** local feature flag "profile-complete" matches person property "plan" with operator "is_set"
- **WHEN** the flag is evaluated locally with person property "plan" explicitly set to null
- **THEN** the local evaluation result should be true
- **AND** the SDK should not require remote fallback solely to interpret the explicit null value

#### Scenario: Other falsey present values match is_set
- **GIVEN** local feature flags use `is_set` filters for properties supplied as false, zero, an empty string, an empty list, and an empty object
- **WHEN** those flags are evaluated locally
- **THEN** each `is_set` property comparison should match

#### Scenario: Missing property context remains inconclusive
- **GIVEN** local feature flag "profile-complete" matches person property "plan" with operator "is_set"
- **WHEN** the flag is evaluated locally without a "plan" entry in the supplied person properties
- **THEN** local evaluation should be inconclusive
- **AND** remote evaluation should remain eligible when enabled
